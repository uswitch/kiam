Notable changes:

## 5.0.0
7 November 2019

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
* [#322](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/322) The chart has been updated to include support for the `--no-iptables-remove` Kiam flag, which is now **enabled by default.**  
`Note:` Using your existing `values.yaml` with this chart will result in the flag being turned on with no user input. This flag leaves the iptables rule (which is necessary for the Kiam agent processes to intercept requests to the metadata API) in place after the Kiam agent has been shutdown.  
Please see the following links for related discussion: [Issue 202](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/issues/202) and [PR #253](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/253).

## 3.0.1
10 September 2019

Notable Changes:
* [#295](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/295) **BUG FIX** - The Kiam server and agent daemonset files have been updated to account for the change to the `values.yaml` file made in [#292](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/292). Without this change, users will experience issues when deploying the v3 release of the Chart with the extraEnv parameters set in `values.yaml`.

## 3.0.0
5 September 2019

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
* [#292](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/292) The `extraEnv` parameters for both the agent and server in `values.yaml` have been changed to support an array of options. This adds support for creating env vars from configMaps or secretKeyRefs.  
`Note:` This will break any existing Helm deployments which utilise the `extraEnv` parameters in `values.yaml`. You will need to update your `values.yaml` file to match the format in the [template](/helm/kiam/values.yaml#L93)

## 2.5.3
29 August 2019

Notable Changes:
* [#288](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/288) Bug fix for correctly rendering port number for certificates.
