## v3.0
6 December 2018

v3 introduces a change to the gRPC API. Servers are compatible with v2.x Agents although **v3 Agents require v3 Servers**. Other breaking changes have been made so it's worth reading through [docs/UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md) for more detail on moving from v2 to v3.

Notable changes:

* [#109](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/109) v3 API
* [#110](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/110) Restrict metadata routes. Everything other than credentials **will be blocked by default**
* [#122](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/122) Record Server error messages as Events on Pod
* [#131](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/131) Replace go-metrics with native Prometheus metrics client
* [#140](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/140) Example Grafana dashboard for Prometheus metrics
* [#163](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/163) Server manifests use 127.0.0.1 rather than localhost to avoid DNS
* [#173](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/173) Metadata Agent uses 301 rather than 308 redirects
* [#180](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/180) Fix race condition with xtables.lock
* [#193](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/193) Add optional pprof http handler to add monitoring in live clusters

## v2.8
1st June 2018

Notable changes:

* [#62](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/62) Documented interfaces to specify when using Kiam with amazon-vpc-cni.
* [#76](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/76) Wait for balancer to have addresses in Gateway. This helps prevent the following errors being reported by the health check command:
```
WARN[0000] error checking health: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = there is no address available
```

## v2.7
30th April 2018

Notable changes:

* Fix [Issue 43](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/issues/43): updates to metadata api paths on m5/c5 instances
* [#41](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/41): Server allows for custom STS session durations with `--session-duration`
* Server uses `cache.NewIndexerInformer` to maintain pod and namespace caches, this also addresses an error identified in [Issue 46](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/issues/46).
* [#54](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/54) Agents can use a `!` prefix on interfaces when configuring iptables rules. This makes it possible to use Kiam with Amazon and Lyft's CNI plugins.
* Servers will wait for the pod and namespache caches to perform a sync with the Kubernetes API server before accepting gRPC connections. This may cause servers to take longer to start but ensures they have recent state before performing any operations.
