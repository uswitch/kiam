## v2.7
30th April 2018

Notable changes:

* Fix [Issue 43](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/issues/43): updates to metadata api paths on m5/c5 instances
* [#41](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/41): Server allows for custom STS session durations with `--session-duration`
* Server uses `cache.NewIndexerInformer` to maintain pod and namespace caches, this also addresses an error identified in [Issue 46](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/issues/46). 
* [#54](https://github.com/uswitch/kiam/pull/54) Agents can use a `!` prefix on interfaces when configuring iptables rules. This makes it possible to use Kiam with Amazon and Lyft's CNI plugins.
* Servers will wait for the pod and namespache caches to perform a sync with the Kubernetes API server before accepting gRPC connections. This may cause servers to take longer to start but ensures they have recent state before performing any operations.
