# Metrics

Kiam can exports both Prometheus and StatsD metrics to determine the health of the
system, check the timing of each RPC call, and monitor the size of the
credentials cache. By default, Prometheus metrics are exported on `localhost:9620`.
StatsD metrics is disabled by default, read below on how to enable them.

## Dashboard

A example Grafana dashboard with Prometheus as datasource is provided [here](dashboard-prom.json), it displays the basic metrics and includes
daemonset status from kube-state-metrics & container metrics from cAdvisor if available.

## Metrics configuration

- The `statsd` flag controls the address to which to send StatsD metrics.
  This is by default `""`. To enable statsD provide a server adress,
  for example `127.0.0.1:8125`
- The `statsd-prefix` flag controls the initial prefix that will be appended to
  Kiam's StatsD metrics. This is by default `kiam`.
- The `statsd-interval` flag controls how frequently the in-memory metrics
  buffer will be flushed to the specified StatsD endpoint. Metrics are
  not aggregated in this buffer and the raw counts will be flushed to the
  underlying StatsD sink. This is by default `100ms`.
- The `prometheus-listen-addr` controls which address Kiam should create a
  Prometheus endpoint on. This is by default `localhost:9620`. The metrics
  themselves can be accessed at `<prometheus-listen-addr>/metrics`.
- The `prometheus-sync-interval` flag controls how frequently Prometheus
  metrics should be updated. This is by default `5s`.
